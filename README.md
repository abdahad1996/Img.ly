# Img.ly
ðŸ’¡ My Motivation for this was based on creating single purpose decoupled components following Solid Principles. I think of the design in a critical and scalable way backed by tests which was very fun to do.

- âœ… MVVM, Clean Architecture
- âœ… Modular Design
- âœ… SOLID Principles
- âœ… TDD, Unit Testing, Integration Testing, Snapshot Testing, and UI Testing using Page Object Pattern
- âœ… Dependency injection and Dependency Inversion
- âœ… Composition Root, Decorator Patterns, Composite Pattern, Command Query Separation, Adapter Pattern
- âœ… Domain-Driven Design

## Requirements

Please solve the following tasks with this kind of data format. Of course, your solution should work with any data in the same format.

1.âœ…  **Fetch and display the data**. 
Your first task is to fetch the data from [`https://ubique.img.ly/frontend-tha/data.json`](https://ubique.img.ly/frontend-tha/data.json) and display it in a navigation hierarchy in your app.

2.âœ…  **Interact with the data**.
Add interaction to the tree. Allow removing and moving children in the list by enabling the edit mode.

3.âœ…  **Fetch additional data.**
If the user clicks on a leaf, fetch data from `https://ubique.img.ly/frontend-tha/entries/${id}.json` (where `${id}` is the id of an entry). Display the data in a detail view on a new screen. Beware that some data might not exist (404 status code).

4.âœ…  **Add theming**
Add the ability to easily change the theme of your UI to a different customized set of colors.

5.âœ…  **Polish the design**
Tweak the overview and detail screens to be aesthetically pleasing. Feel free to make it reflect your personal taste in user interface design.

## DesignTheme
I used the concept of Atomic design to create tokens for colors, fonts, and miscellaneous items together with polymorphism I was able to create different implementations of the combined token and I only had to change the dependency to change the theme of the app.

## Improvements
- add more acceptance tests
- make github action with CI work
- improve design
- improve theming and color
- profile app
- add cache with tests

## Improvements-1 
### (Adding Cache to Leaf Detail)
Since I created single-purpose decoupled components with good abstractions and relied on composition roots to create dependencies that means I can use design patterns like decorators and composite.

let's see how I can add caching to leafNodes without changing any other component.

### Adding caching by intercepting network requests
One extremely beneficial advantage of having a composition root is the ability to inject behaviour into an instance without changing its implementation using the Decorator pattern. I use it to intercept the requests and save the received domain models in the local store.

The following is an example of how I applied the pattern to introduce the caching behaviour after receiving the leaf Nodes. The decorator just conforms to the protocol that the decoratee conforms to and has an additional dependency, the cache, for storing the objects.
```swift
class LeafNodeLoaderCacheDecorator: LeafNodeLoader {
	private let remoteLeafNodeLoader: RemoteLeafNodeLoader
	private let leafNodeCache: LeafNodeCache

	init(remoteLeafNodeLoader: RemoteLeafNodeLoader, leafNodeCache: any LeafNodeCache) {
		self.remoteLeafNodeLoader = remoteLeafNodeLoader
		self.leafNodeCache = leafNodeCache
	}

	func load(id: String) async throws -> LeafNode {
		let node = try await remoteLeafNodeLoader.load(id: id)
		try? await leafNodeCache.save(id: id, node: node)
		return node
	}
}
```
### Adding fallback strategies when network requests fail
The Composite pattern is an effective way to compose multiple implementations of a particular abstraction, executing the first strategy that doesn't fail.

The following is an example of how I composed two strategies of fetching leafNodes using the leafNodeLoader abstraction. I composed two abstractions instead of using concrete types to easily test the composite in isolation and increase the flexibility of the composition as it's not bounded to a given implementation.

```swift
class LeafNodeLoaderWithFallbackComposite: LeafNodeLoader {
	private let primaryLoader: LeafNodeLoader
	private let secondaryLoader: LeafNodeLoader

	init(primaryLoader: LeafNodeLoader, secondaryLoader: LeafNodeLoader) {
		self.primaryLoader = primaryLoader
		self.secondaryLoader = secondaryLoader
	}

	func load(id: String) async throws -> LeafNode {
		do {
			return try await primaryLoader.load(id: id)
		} catch {
			return try await secondaryLoader.load(id: id)
		}
	}
}
```
